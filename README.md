# Blog Example Template

This repository contains the files used in the Curvenote Web tutorial entitled [Start with a Local Folder](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/tutorial-deploy-local) and can be used to follow that tutorial, before trying Curvenote out on your own content.

To do that, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/curvenote/docs-blog-template.git
```

and then delete this `README.md` file from the local folder before you start.
